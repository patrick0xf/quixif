Quick Exif Library - C#

Quixif is a simple library that reads Exif data information from supported file formats (JPG, TIFF, WAV)



It is extremely fast and can be easily optimized to suit any needs

It is useful in scenario where image processing libraries are not available or too slow

It can parse files mid stream (returning the exif data, the data already read) and processing on the stream can continue

Tags and IFD paths are customizable (XML) and new offset types can  be easily added
